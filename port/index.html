          <h2>IT Professional.</h2>
        </div>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Howdy, I'm Peter Muniz - a current IT professional and hopeful front-end (eventually full-stack) web developer. I dabbled in coding for years now and decided to make 2017 the year I land a job as a developer. I started the <em>100-days-of-code</em> challenge and am near completion. During this time, I earned a <a href="http://freecodecamp.com/muni03/front-end-certification" style="color: white">front-end web certification</a> from <em>FreeCodeCamp</em> which I am quite proud of. I'm a dedicated, passionate worker and lifetime learner. Hopefully I can bring my skillset to your company soon.</p>

          <h2 class="cardTitle">Simon</h2>
          <p>My rendition of the 80's classic Simon game. This was a very fun and challenging project for me. It was also the first time I drew real-life objects with CSS which was quite fun.</p>
        </div>

          <h2 class="cardTitle">TicTacToe</h2>
          <p>My first "real" game. Deciding how the computer would know which moves had already been made was quite challenging. I also wanted to keep it interesting and not make the same choices. I think the end-result came out nicely.</p>

          <h2 class="cardTitle">Pomodoro Clock</h2>
          <p>An app I still use today to make sure I get my coding time in. Here, the user can define work and break time lengths and then receive an alert when those limits have been reached. I've always liked this font and finally found a place to use it. </p>

          <h2 class="cardTitle">Twitch</h2>
          <p>My third adventure into the world of JSON. I personally love Twitch and was excited to get the chance to create this friends-list type app. It displays a list of streamers, their status, and what game they're playing. I also added a feature where new streamers can be added to your watch-list.</p>

          <h2 class="cardTitle">Wikipedia Viewer</h2>
          <p>A compact wiki viewer that instantly displays a list of results. I fully realized the power of APIs creating this app. I had no idea how open-source the web really was until this project.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">

          <h2 class="cardTitle">Weather</h2>
          <p>This little app takes your zipcode and returns the weather in your area. At the time, CodePen didn't play well with geolocation since it wasn't HTTPS compliant so I had to default back to manually entering the user's zip. This was my very first time working with JSON and APIs. While it was quite challenging, it ended up being a very rewarding experience.</p>

          <h2 class="cardTitle">Random Quote Machine</h2>
          <p>One of my first projects, this simple quote generator delights the user with various quotes from leaders in the technology field.</p>
